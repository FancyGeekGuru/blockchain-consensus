# Common Attacks

#### 51% attack

In PoS, you would need a majority of all minted coins to conduct such an attack, In PoW, you would need a majority of amining power to conduct such an attack,

#### transaction censoring.

With PoW, a block miner can “choose” not to mine a block containing certain addresses, thereby censoring that address from the network.

#### Sybil attacks

The pBFT mechanisms are susceptible to Sybil attacks, where one entity(party) controls many identities. As the number of nodes in the network increase, sybil attacks become increasingly difficult to carry out. But as pBFT mechanisms have scalability issues too, the pBFT mechanism is used in combination with other mechanism(s).
