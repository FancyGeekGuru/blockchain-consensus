# Dynamic Proof of Location

Todayâ€™s geolocation tools are great for determining the location of a device, but cannot offer reliable and trusted location verification services. They are uni-directional and unencrypted, which makes it problematic to rely on GPS for smart contracts that need to execute when spatial parameters are met. Dynamic Proof of Location empowers a permissionless and autonomous network of radio beacons that can offer secure location verification services through time synchronization in a decentralized manner.

#### Pros

* Trustless: Byzantine fault tolerant clock synchronization
* Independent: Does not rely on GPS
* Open: Anyone can utilize the network or offer utility services
* Accountable: Economics structured to ensure honest behavior, verified with fraud proofs
* Incentivized: Service providers remunerated for extending localization and verification zones
